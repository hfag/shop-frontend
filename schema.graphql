@description
Permissions for administrators and customers. Used to control access to
GraphQL resolvers via the {@link Allow} decorator.

## Understanding Permission.Owner

`Permission.Owner` is a special permission which is used in some Vendure resolvers to indicate that that resolver should only
be accessible to the "owner" of that resource.

For example, the Shop API `activeCustomer` query resolver should only return the Customer object for the "owner" of that Customer, i.e.
based on the activeUserId of the current session. As a result, the resolver code looks like this:

@example
```TypeScript
\@Query()
\@Allow(Permission.Owner)
async activeCustomer(\@Ctx() ctx: RequestContext): Promise<Customer | undefined> {
  const userId = ctx.activeUserId;
  if (userId) {
    return this.customerService.findOneByUserId(ctx, userId);
  }
}
```

Here we can see that the "ownership" must be enforced by custom logic inside the resolver. Since "ownership" cannot be defined generally
nor statically encoded at build-time, any resolvers using `Permission.Owner` **must** include logic to enforce that only the owner
of the resource has access. If not, then it is the equivalent of using `Permission.Public`.
